The pseudocode may contain variables.

Because these variables are dynamically allocated their size cannot be known at compile time.
To avoid inefficiencies, they are contained in a B-tree.
The searchable key is the variable name.
Keywords of the language may not be variable names.

The pseudocode contains no unsigned integers.

Every variable is of the type
struct variable
	unsigned int info
	void *contents
	unsigned short refcount

the last 2 bits of the int type specifies the type of the variable
valid types are:
0 - the variable is undefined
1 - the value is an int
2 - the value is a string
3 - the value is on object

if the var value is a int, the integer value is stored in the pointer.
Be careful not to dereference those!

The remaining bits store the size of the variable.

Structure of the info number
[bits storing the size] [type bits]

The short refcount contains the number of references to this variable.

The variables B-Tree consists of the following structs:

struct varTreeNode
	char *name
	varTreeNode *left
	varTreeNode *right
	variable *var
