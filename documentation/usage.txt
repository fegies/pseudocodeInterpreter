This program has to be run from the command line.

Accepted arguments:

pseudocode [filename]

if no filename is supplied, the program will read the commands from stdin.

code execution from command line arguments is not supported
(The shell would mangle the special inputs anyway and you do not really want
to escape everything, do you?)
