A function is a block of code with a optional return statement that may be called
from anywhere in the code after it has been declared.

After completion of the code inside the function control flow will return to the
position it was before calling the function.

A function call may behave like a variable access does, in that it returns
a variable that can be used in other operations.

A function declaration has the following syntax:
function [name] (Arguments seperated by , ) {
	[Code to be executed]
}

A function call has the following syntax:

[function name](Arguments seperated by , )
