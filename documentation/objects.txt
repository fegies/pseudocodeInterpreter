Before an object can be created it must be defined as a class first.

A class definition may be done anywhere within the source code.
Class definitions follow the standart scoping rules.
Ergo: when control flow leaves a block, any class definitions inside that
block are rendered invalid.

class definitions are made using the following syntax:

class <name> {
	member definitions
};

a member definiton consists of a member name
example:

num
left

The member definitions may be delimited using newlines or semicolons.

Objects must be instanciated using the keyword
new

The keyword new is a builtin function that takes a class variable and returns a
object variable.

The . operator is another builtin function that takes two arguments:
The object being called and the name of the field being referenced.
